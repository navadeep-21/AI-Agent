#AI Agent – Travel Planning Assistant
This project focuses on building an Agentic AI-based travel planning assistant that helps users plan trips intelligently based on their preferences. The assistant interacts with users in natural language and generates personalized multi-day travel itineraries including destinations, schedules, and activity suggestions.

The system is built using LangChain, where an AI agent analyzes user inputs such as travel location, number of days, budget, and interests. Using LLM-powered reasoning, the agent breaks down the request into steps, selects relevant tools, and produces structured travel plans. Prompt chaining is used to maintain context and ensure coherent responses throughout the conversation.

The assistant is designed to behave like a human travel planner, adapting responses dynamically and handling follow-up questions effectively. This project demonstrates skills in agent-based AI design, prompt engineering, and LLM integration, making it suitable for real-world AI assistant applications.

Technologies Used: Python, LangChain, LLMs, Prompt Engineering
